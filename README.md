# UI-Principles

1.	 User Interface is the front end of the website and ultimately what the viewer sees when browsing the site.
2.	User experience is the tools that are available to the user to provide a smooth web browsing experience. User interface is the layout of those tools in the most efficient and cleanest way possible.
3.	A mock up is like a rough draft of an essay, you have a pretty good idea of what the outcome will look like but its still rough around the edges and needs polishing.
•	 Low fidelity is like a paper mock up that has no functions and cant really do anything, just a lay out for the high fidelity mock up.
•	High fidelity is the computerized mock up that will give you a better understanding of how the site will look and work.
4.	Mobile first design is the act of designing a website/app starting from the more limited view from a mobile device. Most coders make a desktop version before the mobile layout; this design process is the opposite of that.
5.	Front end developers should be in control of user interface because they are more fit for the design process that it takes to build a clean, good looking website.
6.	Reusable components are functions on your site that can be useful across multiple layers, this means these components should be fairly simple so that they can be easily implemented.
